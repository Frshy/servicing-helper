# Servicing Helper

## A task given to me by Kamil from Likescoding (company's head)
Main idea of the project is to help managing servicing with (simple) admin panel.

Tasks are "given" (more like splitted and managed) as issues in issues tab. <br>

This project uses multiple microservices, normally I would split it into multiple repositories - one for each microservice, but since I am doing it only by myself I do not find it necessery to do - it would take more time to review it.
